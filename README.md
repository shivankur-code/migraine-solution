# Still: a quiet room for migraine days

Still is a phone app for the moment a headache starts. It opens on a dark **quiet room** with three choices:
- a dark screen with no sound
- **your** comfort sound
- a softer, darker version of it

Sound starts quietly, fades in slowly, and keeps playing with the phone locked. A **journal** groups your sessions into headache episodes so you can see what you reach for. **Tune my sound** learns which sound feels gentlest to you from simple "which felt calmer?" choices.

Still is for comfort. It does not diagnose, treat or prevent migraine. A new, sudden or worst-ever headache needs medical care.

This is the React Native (Expo) version of the web prototype in [Harshelite2503/still-sound-lab](https://github.com/Harshelite2503/still-sound-lab). It uses the same sound engine, preference learner and journal logic.

## Screens

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Quiet room** (`src/app/index.tsx`) | Silence first, then your comfort sound, then a softer version. Plays at the "headache now" level: 14 dB below a normal day, with a 6-second-plus fade-in. "Warning signs" and "Recovering" are 6 dB quieter than a normal day. "This is making it worse" stops the sound and makes that state 4 dB quieter next time. Sleep timer, and a dark screen while sound plays. Nothing asks you questions while it plays. |
| **First-run setup** (`src/components/Onboarding.tsx`) | About 30 seconds: one question (which sounds are hardest), pick a texture by ear, turn one Tone dial while it plays. Every step can be skipped. |
| **Cymatics** (`src/lib/cymatics.js`, `src/components/Cymatics*.tsx`) | Each sound has its own Chladni figure, the pattern sand makes on a vibrating plate: darker tone, simpler figure; hum adds rings; motion breathes with the sound's swell. Loose dust gathers into the figure when sound plays. Canvas with thousands of grains on the web (moves with the real audio level), a few hundred native grains on phones. Slow, no flashing, still under Reduce Motion. |
| **Journal** (`src/app/journal.tsx`) | Episodes (sessions within 12 hours count as one), how it felt afterwards, and one-tap notes for headaches without Still. |
| **My sound** (`src/app/tune.tsx`) | A small mixer: four textures and four click-stop dials (Tone, Hum, Motion, Space) that change the sound as it plays (`src/components/Dial.tsx`, `Studio.tsx`). Optional "choose by ear" A/B rounds, and account/privacy settings, sit behind one tap each. |

## Web landing page

The web build has one extra page, `/welcome` (`src/app/welcome.tsx`, drawn by `src/components/landing/Landing.web.tsx` and `landing.css`). It explains Still in plain words: the three choices, the silent start and slow fade-in, what stays on the device, how the sound is tuned by ear, and the medical line. It plays no sound and has nothing to adjust. Every button on it says "Open the quiet room", and the very first line of the page offers that same way out for anyone with a headache right now.

- A browser that has neither finished setup nor seen the page before is sent to `/welcome` once (`src/lib/welcome.ts`). Opening the quiet room from the page sets `still.welcomed` in local storage; finishing or skipping setup sets `onboarded`. Either one means the room opens directly from then on.
- Phones never see it: on iOS and Android `/welcome` goes straight to the quiet room.
- It uses the fonts bundled with the app, nothing from the network, and honours reduced motion and reduced transparency.
- The deploy (`.github/workflows/web.yml`, `scripts/deploy-web.sh`) uploads `welcome` as a route file alongside `tune` and `journal`, so a direct link loads with a normal 200.

## Behaviour changes in the UI revamp

- **Loudness and the sleep timer hide while sound plays.** They fade out when the sound starts and come back when it stops, because changing either would stop the sound by surprise. The line under the lamp shows the current loudness and timer instead.
- **Softer is the way to go quieter during a session.** It turns the sound down and the room darker without stopping anything.
- **The "how did that go?" check-in is a sheet**, not a card in the page. It rises below the lamp only after the sound stops, never while it plays; the lamp stays visible and tappable, and the sheet can be dragged down, skipped, or left to close by itself after 90 seconds. On a wide screen it is an inline card.
- **New `/welcome` route on the web**, described above.

## Privacy

**Your sound is made entirely on the phone.** The questionnaire, comfort contour, listening tests, preference learning, recipe rules and sound synthesis all run locally. Answers and the journal are stored only on the device (AsyncStorage). There are no accounts, no analytics, no tracking and no ads.

The only feature that sends anything is the **optional AI review**. It is off until the person switches it on, and they can preview the exact data first.
- **Minimised:** it sends sound-relevant answers only, as simple flags (for example "dizzy: yes"), plus measured values and journal counts. It never sends aura, headache frequency, what currently helps, exact anxiety or dizziness levels, names, dates, notes or device identifiers.
- **Not stored and not used for training:** the server keeps nothing, and the OpenRouter requests use `data_collection: "deny"`, so they only go to providers that neither store nor train on them.
- **Bounded:** whatever comes back is validated and clamped by the on-device safety rules.

Without the AI review, Still is fully offline after install.

## How sound works

`src/engine/comfort-engine.js` renders a seamless, loudness-normalised stereo loop in JavaScript, about 6 seconds long. `src/lib/player.ts` caches it as a WAV file and plays it with `expo-audio` on loop. Volume always ramps and never jumps. Background playback is on: `UIBackgroundModes: audio` on iOS and a media-playback foreground service on Android. Both come from the `expo-audio` config plugin in `app.json`.

## Run it

You need Node 22. This project uses native modules (`expo-audio` with background playback), so use a development build, not Expo Go.

```bash
npm install
npm test            # engine and journal logic
npx tsc --noEmit    # typecheck
npx expo run:android   # needs Android Studio / SDK, or use the Azure build below
npx expo run:ios       # needs a Mac with Xcode
```

## Builds

- **Android, free:** the "Android build" GitHub Actions workflow builds a release APK on every app change. GitHub runners are free for public repositories. Download it from the run as `Still-android`.
- **Android on Azure:** `scripts/azure-android-build.sh`. It uses a Spot VM first (about $0.07/h, so roughly 1–2 cents a build) and falls back to a regular VM. It creates a temporary Ubuntu VM in your Azure subscription, builds a release APK (arm64 phones), uploads it to a private storage account, prints a 7-day download link, and deletes the VM. It needs `az login`. A build takes about 12 minutes; stored APKs are deleted automatically after 14 days. The APK is signed with the debug key, which is fine for testing but not for the Play Store.
- **iOS on GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/ios.yml` runs the tests and typecheck, then builds an iOS Simulator app on macOS and attaches it to the run as `Still-ios-simulator`. To install on real iPhones (TestFlight), add an Apple Developer account ($99 a year) and signing secrets. That step is not set up yet.
